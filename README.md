# shop-auth
This is one of the services in my application.
This service accepts requests from the shop-front service of my application and handles all operations related to authentication and registration of new users.
For this I used postgres database. And the application itself uses Sping, Sping Data JPA. Security is provided by Spring Security. Access to the service only by JWT token.
